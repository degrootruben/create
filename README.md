# Create
Create is a little tool I wrote which creates the necessary direcotries and files
for me whenever I start a new project. I am currently learning C++ and this
project let me put my learning into practice. I am aware that this could also be written in just C instead of C++ but I am not currently learning C.

## Usage
``` create *project name* ```
